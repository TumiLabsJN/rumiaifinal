## Production Tips for Easy Filming:

### Equipment Needed:
- Phone camera (vertical orientation)
- Tripod or phone stand (optional but helpful)
- Good lighting (window light works)
- Quiet room for clear audio

### Filming Order (Easiest to Hardest):
1. **Start with Minimal** - Just atmosphere shots
2. **Then Tutorials** - Simple talking head
3. **Then Story** - Emotional changes
4. **Then Product** - Props needed
5. **Then Text Heavy** - Post-production editing
6. **End with High Energy** - Most exhausting
7. **Edge Case** - Requires video effects

### Editing Apps for Effects:
- **CapCut** (Free) - Good for text overlays, cuts, effects
- **InShot** - Simple and effective
- **TikTok's built-in editor** - Has all needed effects

### Text Overlay Consistency:
- Use same font for each video (for easier OCR validation)
- High contrast (white text, black outline)
- Keep text on screen for at least 2 seconds
- Position consistently (top/middle/bottom)

### Audio Tips:
- Record speech clearly - speak toward camera
- Add music in post (TikTok's library is fine)
- For "silence" sections, actually have NO audio
- For peak moments, layer music + speech + effects

### Validation Helpers:
- Say timestamps out loud during filming ("This is the 10-second mark")
- Use finger counting for scene changes
- Exaggerate emotions for clarity
- Make CTAs super obvious

### File Organization:
After uploading to TikTok and downloading:
