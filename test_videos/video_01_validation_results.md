# Video 01 - High Energy Peaks Test - Validation Results

## Test Video Info
- **Video ID**: 7537417181332557061
- **Duration**: 31 seconds
- **Type**: High Energy with 2 peaks
- **URL**: https://www.tiktok.com/@jorgen1833/video/7537417181332557061

## Key Findings

### ✅ SUCCESSES

1. **Speech Detection** - EXCELLENT
   - Detected: 106% coverage (full video)
   - Expected: 100%
   - Transcription includes "Wait, wait, wait! Stop scrolling!" ✅

2. **Text Overlay Detection** - PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - Detected: 4 text overlays
   - Expected: 7 text overlays
   - Key texts found:
     - "PEAK MOMENT" at 12s ✅ (matches your peak at 12-16s)
     - "FOLLOW" at 31s ✅
     - "Archive" at 11s (possibly misread text?)
   - Missing: "STOP SCROLLING", numbers "1 2 3", "SECOND PEAK"

3. **CTA Detection** - SUCCESS
   - Detected "follow" CTA at 30s (speech) and 31s (text) ✅
   - Expected: CTA at 29-31s

4. **Temporal Markers** - PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - First 5 seconds: Detected high density (8,6,6,7,9)
   - Detected speech segments in opening
   - CTA window correctly identified (26-31s)

### ❌ FAILURES

1. **Scene Detection** - COMPLETE FAILURE
   - Detected: 0 scenes
   - Expected: ~8 scene changes
   - Issue: Scene detection algorithm didn't recognize your cuts

2. **Peak Moment Detection** - FAILURE
   - Peak moments array was empty in temporal markers
   - Expected peaks at 0:14 and 0:25
   - However, text "PEAK MOMENT" was detected at correct time

3. **Energy Pattern** - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
   - Need to check if energy levels match expected pattern
   - Visual overlay shows peak at 9-12s (close to your 12-16s)

### ⚠️ PARTIAL MATCHES

1. **Text Detection Accuracy**
   - Only 4 of 7 texts detected (57% accuracy)
   - Possible issues:
     - Text too brief on screen
     - Font/style not recognized
     - "Archive" might be misread text

2. **Timing Alignment**
   - Peak text detected at 12s (you jumped at 12-16s)
   - Small timing offset but within acceptable range

## Validation Summary

| Component | Expected | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Speech Coverage | 100% | 106% | ✅ PASS |
| Text Count | 7 (±2) | 4 | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Scene Count | 8 (±3) | 0 | ❌ FAIL |
| Peak 1 Detection | 0:12-0:16 | Text at 0:12 | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Peak 2 Detection | 0:24-0:26 | Not detected | ❌ FAIL |
| CTA Detection | 0:29-0:31 | 0:30-0:31 | ✅ PASS |
| Opening Hook | Strong | Detected | ✅ PASS |

## Overall Result: 57% Pass Rate (4/7 components)

## Issues to Address

1. **Scene Detection Algorithm**
   - Threshold may be too high
   - Not detecting manual cuts/angle changes
   - Consider adjusting ContentDetector settings

2. **OCR Text Recognition**
   - Missing several text overlays
   - May need better handling of animated/brief text
   - "Archive" appears to be misread

3. **Peak Detection in Temporal Markers**
   - Energy peaks not being identified despite correct text detection
   - May need to adjust peak detection algorithm

## Recommendations

1. Lower scene detection threshold
2. Improve OCR for brief/animated text
3. Fix peak detection algorithm in temporal markers
4. Test with actual TikTok music to see if energy detection improves

## Next Steps

1. Film Video 2 with more dramatic scene changes
2. Include longer-duration text overlays
3. Add actual TikTok music for better energy testing
