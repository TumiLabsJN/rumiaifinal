# GazeFix Final - Complete Gaze Steadiness Implementation

## Executive Summary
`gazeSteadiness` is the last remaining hardcoded value showing "unknown" in person framing metrics. This fix will calculate actual gaze steadiness based on the variance of eye contact scores over time.

## Current State
- ✅ Eye contact rate: **Working** (0.83 calculated from gaze data)
- ✅ Subject count: **Working** (3 detected from MediaPipe faces)  
- ❌ Gaze steadiness: **Broken** (hardcoded "unknown")

## Problem Analysis

### What's Wrong
The current implementation in `precompute_functions_full.py:2426-2432`:
```python
# CURRENT (BROKEN):
if gaze_analysis and 'eye_contact_ratio' in gaze_analysis:
    # Using eye contact ratio as proxy - WRONG!
    eye_contact = gaze_analysis['eye_contact_ratio']
    if eye_contact > 0.7:
        metrics['gaze_steadiness'] = 'high'
    elif eye_contact > 0.4:
        metrics['gaze_steadiness'] = 'medium'
    else:
        metrics['gaze_steadiness'] = 'low'
else:
    metrics['gaze_steadiness'] = 'unknown'
```

**Issues:**
1. Uses eye contact ratio (average) instead of variance (consistency)
2. High eye contact ≠ steady gaze (could be erratic but frequent)
3. Always returns 'unknown' because gaze_analysis is not populated correctly

### What Steadiness Actually Means
- **Steady gaze**: Consistent eye contact values with low variance
- **Unsteady gaze**: Fluctuating eye contact values with high variance
- Example: [0.8, 0.85, 0.82, 0.79] = steady, [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2] = unsteady

## The Fix

### Step 1: Collect Eye Contact Scores
**Location**: `precompute_functions_full.py:2311-2316`

```python
# FIXED VERSION:
eye_contact_frames = 0
eye_contact_scores = []  # NEW: Collect all scores for variance

for timestamp, gaze_data in gaze_timeline.items():
    eye_contact_value = gaze_data.get('eye_contact', 0)
    if eye_contact_value > 0:  # Any valid measurement
        eye_contact_scores.append(eye_contact_value)  # NEW: Store value
        if eye_contact_value > 0.5:
            eye_contact_frames += 1

eye_contact_ratio = eye_contact_frames / total_frames if total_frames > 0 else 0
```

### Step 2: Calculate Variance-Based Steadiness
**Location**: Add after line 2316

```python
# NEW: Calculate gaze steadiness from variance
import statistics

if len(eye_contact_scores) > 1:
    gaze_variance = statistics.variance(eye_contact_scores)
    
    # Lower variance = steadier gaze
    if gaze_variance < 0.05:  # Very consistent (±0.22 std dev)
        calculated_gaze_steadiness = 'high'
    elif gaze_variance < 0.15:  # Moderate consistency (±0.39 std dev)
        calculated_gaze_steadiness = 'medium'
    else:  # High variance, unstable gaze
        calculated_gaze_steadiness = 'low'
elif len(eye_contact_scores) == 1:
    calculated_gaze_steadiness = 'high'  # Single measurement = perfectly steady
else:
    calculated_gaze_steadiness = 'unknown'  # No gaze data
```

### Step 3: Use Calculated Value
**Location**: `precompute_functions_full.py:2426-2432`

```python
# REPLACE the broken gaze_analysis logic with:
metrics['gaze_steadiness'] = calculated_gaze_steadiness
```

### Step 4: Add to Metrics Dictionary
**Location**: `precompute_functions_full.py:2400-2404`

```python
metrics = {
    # ... existing fields ...
    'gaze_steadiness': calculated_gaze_steadiness,  # Use calculated value
    # Remove the later gaze_analysis override
}
```

## Threshold Justification

### Variance Thresholds
- **< 0.05**: High steadiness (std dev < 0.22)
  - Eye contact varies by less than ±22%
  - Example: [0.8, 0.85, 0.75, 0.82] → variance = 0.0017

- **0.05 - 0.15**: Medium steadiness (std dev 0.22-0.39)
  - Eye contact varies by ±22-39%
  - Example: [0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.85] → variance = 0.014

- **> 0.15**: Low steadiness (std dev > 0.39)
  - Eye contact varies by more than ±39%
  - Example: [0.9, 0.2, 0.8, 0.1] → variance = 0.147

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Current)
```json
{
  "eyeContactRate": 0.83,
  "gazeSteadiness": "unknown"  // Always unknown
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "eyeContactRate": 0.83,
  "gazeSteadiness": "high"  // Based on actual variance
}
```

### Test Case Analysis
For video 7274651255392210219:
- Eye contact values: [0.81, 0.84, 0.90, 0.92, 0.87, ...]
- Expected variance: ~0.003 (very low)
- Expected result: `"gazeSteadiness": "high"`

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Import statistics module at top of file
2. [ ] Add eye_contact_scores list collection
3. [ ] Calculate variance after collecting all scores
4. [ ] Map variance to steadiness levels
5. [ ] Replace hardcoded logic with calculated value
6. [ ] Remove gaze_analysis override at end of function
7. [ ] Test with videos having different gaze patterns

## Validation Strategy

### Test Videos Needed
1. **Steady gaze video**: Person maintaining eye contact
2. **Unsteady gaze video**: Person looking around frequently
3. **No gaze video**: No faces detected

### Expected Outputs
1. Steady: `"gazeSteadiness": "high"` with low variance
2. Unsteady: `"gazeSteadiness": "low"` with high variance
3. No gaze: `"gazeSteadiness": "unknown"` with no data

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Measures the right metric**: Variance captures consistency, not average
2. **Uses existing data**: Gaze timeline already has eye contact scores
3. **Simple calculation**: Standard statistical variance
4. **Meaningful thresholds**: Based on practical gaze behavior
5. **Graceful degradation**: Returns "unknown" when no data

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Temporal smoothness**: Measure frame-to-frame changes
   - More complex, similar results
   
2. **Gaze direction variance**: Use x/y coordinates
   - Would need additional data extraction
   
3. **Sliding window analysis**: Per-second variance
   - Overly complex for current needs

## Conclusion

This fix transforms `gazeSteadiness` from a hardcoded placeholder to a meaningful metric based on actual gaze consistency. The implementation is straightforward, uses existing data, and provides actionable insights about viewer attention patterns.
