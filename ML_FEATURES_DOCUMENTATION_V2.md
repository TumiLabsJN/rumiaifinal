1. **DIRECT FEATURES (274 features)**: Can be used as-is in ML models
   - Numeric scores, ratios, counts
   - Example: `speechDensity=3.63`, `emotionalDiversity=0.85`
   - Ready for immediate input to neural networks or tree-based models

2. **TIME SERIES FEATURES (8 features)**: Require aggregation or embedding
   - Temporal progressions, patterns over time
   - Example: `emotionProgression[]`, `wpmProgression[]`
   - Can be processed with RNNs, LSTMs, or statistical aggregation

3. **STRUCTURED FEATURES (110 features)**: Need flattening or encoding
   - Complex objects with multiple properties
   - Example: `keyMoments[{timestamp, intensity}]`
   - Require feature engineering or embedding layers

### Python Implementation Architecture
