## Conclusion

This enhanced documentation reveals that approximately **75% of features are legitimate** (based on real ML data or computed from it), while **25% are estimated or placeholder**. The most critical gap is **emotion detection**, which affects an entire analysis category. 

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Core ML services work well**: YOLO, MediaPipe, Whisper, OCR, Scene Detection provide solid foundation
2. **Major gap in emotion**: MediaPipe doesn't do emotion recognition - system uses fake mappings
3. **Missing effect detection**: Visual effects and transitions are not actually detected
4. **Pattern classifications need ML**: Most pattern/style features use rule-based heuristics

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate**: Implement real emotion detection to fix Emotional Journey
2. **Short-term**: Add effect detection and audio analysis
3. **Long-term**: Replace rule-based classifiers with trained models
4. **Documentation**: Clearly mark estimated features in API responses
