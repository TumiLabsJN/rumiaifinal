  3. Feature selection strategy - Not addressed (which features matter most?)

INSTRUCTIONS

First, explain what this means. Then share alternatives of how could we fix


Revise MLProjectsGrassrootsv2.md , is this still an issue we need to solve?


These types of failures should lead to fail fast philosophy which would lead to fixing the bugs. However, we need to create a system where if I initiate the analysis of 40 videos per bucket for a hashtag.
20% in there is a bug that triggers fail fast, 
For after fixing the bug, us to be able to continue from where we left off of the video analysis.

**Dont create Technical debt nightmares. Never go for band-aid solutions. Fix the fundamental architectural problem.

# ML Project Implementation Gaps Analysis
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Purpose**: Identify missing business requirements and technical specifications needed for RumiAI ML Training Pipeline

## üö® Critical Business Information Missing

## üîß Technical Implementation Gaps


### 2. Feature Engineering Pipeline
**Current Gap**: How to transform 432 features into ML-ready format

**Questions**:
- Do we use all 432 features or select subset?
- How do we handle different data types (scalar, array, nested)?
- Do we need feature scaling/normalization?
- How do we encode temporal features (progressions, timelines)?
- Should we create aggregate features (means, peaks, trends)?
- How do we handle missing data (failed ML detections)?

### 3. Data Storage Architecture
**Current Gap**: No database design for ML training data

**Requirements Unclear**:
```sql
-- Need schema design for:
CREATE TABLE clients (
    client_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR,
    industry VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE hashtags (
    hashtag_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id UUID REFERENCES clients,
    name VARCHAR,
    url VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE videos (
    video_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    hashtag_id UUID REFERENCES hashtags,
    duration_segment VARCHAR,
    metrics JSONB,  -- engagement data
    features JSONB,  -- 432 features
    analysis_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE patterns (
    pattern_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    hashtag_id UUID REFERENCES hashtags,
    pattern_data JSONB,
    confidence FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. Batch Processing Error Handling
**Current Gap**: Checkpoint system design incomplete

**Specifications Needed**:
- Where to store checkpoints? (Local file, database, Redis?)
- What constitutes recoverable vs non-recoverable failure?
- How to handle partial feature extraction (some ML models fail)?
- Should we retry failed videos? How many times?
- How to report failures to user?
- Can we process videos with missing features?

### 5. Pattern Aggregation Logic
**Current Gap**: How to aggregate patterns across videos

**Unknown Algorithms**:
```python
def aggregate_patterns(video_analyses: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """
    How do we combine 30-50 video analyses into patterns?
    
    Options:
    1. Statistical: Mean, median, mode of features
    2. Frequency: Most common combinations
    3. Clustering: Group similar videos
    4. Ranking: Top features by correlation with engagement
    5. Sequential: Temporal pattern mining
    
    What's the logic?
    """
    pass
```

## üìä Data Requirements Gaps

### 1. Engagement Data Source
**Current Gap**: Where does engagement data come from?

**Questions**:
- Does Apify provide engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)?
- How fresh does engagement data need to be?
- Do we need to track engagement over time (viral trajectory)?
- What if engagement data is missing or incomplete?

### 2. Training Data Volume
**Current Gap**: How much data is needed for reliable patterns?

**Unknowns**:
- Minimum videos per pattern identification?
- Statistical significance requirements?
- Cross-validation approach?
- How to handle imbalanced segments (few 91-120s videos)?

### 3. Historical Data
**Current Gap**: Do we use existing analyses or start fresh?

**Questions**:
- Can we import the thousands of videos already analyzed?
- How do we handle version differences in feature extraction?
- Should we re-analyze old videos with new ML models?

---

## üéØ Apify Integration Gaps

### 1. Search & Filter Capabilities
**Current Gap**: Unclear what Apify can actually filter by

**Need to Verify**:
```python
# Can Apify actually filter by:
- Duration ranges (0-15s, 16-30s, etc.)?
- Post date (after specific date)?
- Minimum engagement thresholds?
- Sort by engagement rate vs views?
- Hashtag AND duration AND date simultaneously?

# Current implementation just downloads from URL:
apify_client.download_video(url)
# Need: apify_client.search_videos(filters)
```

### 2. Rate Limits & Costs
**Current Gap**: No mention of Apify limitations

**Questions**:
- API rate limits for searching/downloading?
- Cost per video download?
- Can we batch download 200 videos?
- Storage requirements for video files?

---

## üîê Privacy & Competitive Concerns

### 1. Data Isolation
**Current Gap**: How strict is client data separation?

**Requirements**:
- Can Client A's patterns influence Client B's analysis?
- How do we prevent data leakage between competitors?
- Should each client have separate ML models?
- Can we use industry-wide patterns as baseline?

### 2. Intellectual Property
**Current Gap**: Who owns the patterns/insights?

**Questions**:
- Can we reuse learned patterns across clients?
- Do clients own their specific patterns?
- Can we build industry benchmarks?

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness Gaps

### 1. Scale Considerations
**Current Gap**: System designed for 200 videos, but what about scale?

**Questions**:
- What happens with 1000+ videos?
- Memory requirements for ML training?
- Processing time expectations?
- Concurrent client analyses?

### 2. Update Frequency
**Current Gap**: Is this one-time analysis or ongoing?

**Questions**:
- How often do we retrain models?
- Do we track pattern drift over time?
- How do we handle trending content changes?

### 3. A/B Testing Integration
**Current Gap**: How do recommendations become tests?

**Questions**:
- How do we structure recommendations for A/B testing?
- How do we track which recommendations were implemented?
- What's the feedback loop for test results?

---

## üìã Priority Questions for Implementation

### Must Answer Before Development:

1. **ML Approach**: Supervised vs Unsupervised? What's the target variable?
2. **Success Metric**: What defines a "successful" pattern?
3. **Creative Taxonomy**: Exact definition of creative elements
4. **Data Volume**: Minimum videos for statistical significance
5. **Report Format**: Specific output structure and audience

### Must Verify Technically:

1. **Apify Capabilities**: Can it filter by duration/date/engagement?
2. **Feature Selection**: Which of 432 features are relevant?
3. **Storage Solution**: Database vs filesystem for ML data
4. **Aggregation Logic**: How to combine multiple video analyses
5. **Claude API Limits**: Can we send aggregated data from 50+ videos?

### Must Define Business Rules:

1. **Performance Thresholds**: What's "top performing"?
2. **Industry Categories**: Specific classification system
3. **Client Isolation**: Data separation requirements
4. **Pattern Confidence**: Minimum threshold for recommendations
5. **Update Frequency**: One-time vs ongoing analysis

## üé¨ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Detailed Creative Taxonomy Document**
   - Define every creative element type
   - Establish hierarchy and relationships
   - Create coding system for combinations

2. **Run Proof of Concept**
   - Test with 10 videos from one hashtag
   - Try different ML approaches
   - Validate Apify filtering capabilities

3. **Define Success Metrics**
   - Establish baseline performance
   - Create validation methodology
   - Design feedback collection system

4. **Design Data Schema**
   - Create complete database design
   - Plan storage architecture
   - Design checkpoint system

5. **Build Example Report**
   - Mock up exact output format
   - Get stakeholder approval
   - Define all fields and visualizations

Without answering these questions, we cannot build a robust ML training pipeline. Each gap represents a potential point of failure or rework in the implementation.
