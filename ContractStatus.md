## Critical Gaps (High Importance + Not Implemented)

### TOP PRIORITY - High Risk to ML Pipeline
1. **FrameExtractionContract** - Bad frames corrupt ALL ML analysis
2. **FrameValidationContract** - Invalid frames cause ML failures
3. **FrameManagerContract** - Central frame distribution errors
4. **FEATContract** - Emotion detection is core to analysis
5. **TemporalConsistencyContract** - Gaps cause missing analysis

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Visible in Results
1. **SceneDetectionContract** - Wrong scenes = bad pacing
2. **EmotionalJourneyContract** - Emotion errors very visible
3. **WhisperContract** - Affects multiple analyses
4. **MediaPipeContract** - Critical for person framing

### Already Covered (Low Priority)
- Most compute function contracts (covered by ComputeContract)
- Most utility contracts (redundant with existing validators)
- Metadata contracts (don't affect ML analysis)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**: Implement Frame contracts - these are the foundation of ML pipeline
2. **Next Priority**: Complete ML Service contracts for FEAT, Scene Detection
3. **Consider Consolidating**: Many redundant contracts could be merged
4. **Already Strong**: Timeline and base infrastructure contracts are well-implemented
