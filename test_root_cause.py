"""Root cause analysis - WHY does the code look for wrong structure?"""

print("=== ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ===\n")

print("1. WHY does code look for .get('data', {})?")
print("   ANSWER: Original code (from day 1) assumed nested structure")
print("   - Git history shows this was present from initial commit")
print("   - Code was written BEFORE ML services were implemented")
print("   - Classic case of 'code written to assumed spec, not actual implementation'")
print("")

print("2. Was there a schema change?")
print("   ANSWER: NO - there was never a working nested format")
print("   - ML services have always produced flat format: {'textAnnotations': [...]}")
print("   - The nested format was NEVER correct")
print("   - Helpers were added in 'Post Corsica fixing Bugs' commit to handle this")
print("")

print("3. Why are there TWO compute_creative_density_wrapper functions?")
print("   ANSWER: Attempted fix that was abandoned")
print("   - Line 96: Someone started fixing it with helpers")
print("   - Line 366: Original broken version")
print("   - The fix at line 96 was never completed ('Continue with existing logic...')")
print("   - Python uses the LAST definition (line 366), so fix never took effect")
print("")

print("4. Why do helpers exist if they're not being used?")
print("   ANSWER: Partial fix attempt during 'Post Corsica fixing Bugs'")
print("   - Someone recognized the problem")
print("   - Created helpers to handle format issues")
print("   - Started implementing at line 96")
print("   - Never finished or activated the fix")
print("   - Comment says: 'Format extraction helpers for compatibility with both old and new formats'")
print("")

print("=== THE TIMELINE ===")
print("1. Initial commit: Code written with wrong assumptions about data format")
print("2. System deployed: Extraction always returned 0 (never worked)")
print("3. 'Post Corsica': Someone noticed, added helpers, started fix")
print("4. Fix abandoned: Incomplete implementation at line 96")
print("5. Present: System still using original broken code at line 366")
print("")

print("=== KEY INSIGHTS ===")
print("• The 'old format' mentioned in helpers NEVER EXISTED")
print("• Code has NEVER successfully extracted ML data")
print("• Helpers were the attempted solution, not the cause")
print("• The incomplete fix shows someone understood the problem")
print("• Technical debt: Abandoned fix left as dead code")
print("")

print("=== RISK ASSESSMENT ===")
print("Q: Will fixing this break something expecting old format?")
print("A: NO - Nothing ever received the old format because:")
print("   - Extraction always returned empty timelines")
print("   - Claude has always received 0 elements")
print("   - No downstream code depends on the broken extraction")
print("")

print("=== CONCLUSION ===")
print("Safe to fix: No working code depends on the broken format")
print("Root cause: Incorrect assumptions from day 1, never validated")
print("Helpers are the solution, not the problem")
